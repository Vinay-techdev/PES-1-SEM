# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations and notes for **Data Structures and Algorithms** learned during my **1st Semester coursework** at PES.

The purpose of this repository is to practice core data structures, understand algorithmic concepts, and build a strong foundation in problem-solving using C.
