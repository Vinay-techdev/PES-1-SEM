# 📘 PRATICAL Repository

This repository contains my **college practical codes, diagrams, and learning materials** for **Data Structures (DS)** and **Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE)**.  
I created this repo to store all practical implementations, UML diagrams, and learning references in one place.

## 🧠 Data Structures (DS)
This folder contains **college-level implementation codes** written for understanding core concepts:

- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stack (Array & Linked List)
- Queue (Normal, Circular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix & List, BFS, DFS)

> All codes are written in a **simple and clean college-style format** for learning and exams.
